# Superhero API

Dear Reader,

Thank you for taking the time to read and evaluate my code. I truly appreciate it! :)

Before you start reviewing, I want to share a few points to keep in mind:

- This is my first API written in JavaScript. Most of my experience is in Java and Spring Boot.  
- I learned NestJS by watching 6 hours of tutorials and reading documentation.  
- I spent around 4 hours coding and exploring NestJS, which was a great experience overall.  

While reviewing, you might find some parts frustrating or others enjoyableâ€”I completely understand! I often feel the same way about my own code, even when I revisit something I wrote just a week ago. So, please keep these points in mind as you evaluate.

Lastly, if I had more time, I would have added pagination and connected a database using an ORM and add unit test as well as automated api test. These are improvements I hope to make in the future :).

Thank you again for your time, and I hope you have a calm and productive code review! :)
